I am a software engineer who is motivated to build quality software, with special interest in the verification of autonomous systems and combining machine learning with software testing. As a researcher, I developed novel software testing techniques for various types of systems, including machine-learning-enabled systems, embedded consumer electronics, automotive OS, and binary code.
