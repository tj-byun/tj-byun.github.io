excerpt: 'The automotive operating system is a typical safety-critical system that is tightly coupled with the operational environment through system services. However, existing automated techniques come short of testing the interface of such operating systems. We introduced an automated test generation method for system-level safety testing of the automotive operating systems, by utilizing the operational constraints defined in the specification. This work extends the idea by adding configuration-dependent and state-dependent constraint patterns, and by developing a tool chain to automate the constraint-based system-level testing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments, and a comparative analysis is performed between our method and concolic testing.'

The automotive operating system is a typical safety-critical system that is tightly coupled with the operational environment through system services. However, existing automated techniques come short of testing the interface of such operating systems. We introduced an automated test generation method for system-level safety testing of the automotive operating systems, by utilizing the operational constraints defined in the specification. This work extends the idea by adding configuration-dependent and state-dependent constraint patterns, and by developing a tool chain to automate the constraint-based system-level testing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments, and a comparative analysis is performed between our method and concolic testing.
